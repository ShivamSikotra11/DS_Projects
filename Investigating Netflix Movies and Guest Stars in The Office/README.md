# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

## Project Overview
> This project focuses on analyzing Netflix movie data and exploring the trend in movie durations over time. The goal is to determine if there has been a decline in the average duration of movies released on Netflix between 2011 and 2020.

## Implementation
> The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` file. The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and data manipulation and visualization techniques are applied to analyze the movie durations.

## Data
> The project uses a `netfilx_data.csv` file containing Netflix movie data. The file includes information such as movie titles, release years, genres, countries, and durations and is located in `datasets` folder .
