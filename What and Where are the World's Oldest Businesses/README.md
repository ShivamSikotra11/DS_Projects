# What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses

## Project Overview
> This project aims to analyze the oldest businesses in the world. The dataset contains information about the oldest businesses in various countries, including their names, year founded, category code, and country code. The analysis explores factors that enable businesses to stand the test of time and also examines the distribution of oldest businesses across continents and industries.

## Implementation
> The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb`. The project is implemented using Python and the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset is loaded into pandas DataFrames, and various operations such as sorting, merging, grouping, and filtering are performed to extract insights from the data. The results are then displayed or stored for further analysis.

## Data
> The project utilizes the following datasets:
> 
> - `businesses.csv`: Contains information about the oldest businesses, including their names, year founded, category code, and country code.
> - `countries.csv`: Provides details about different countries, including their country codes, names, and continents.
> - `categories.csv`: Describes the category codes and corresponding descriptions for different business categories.
> - `new_businesses.csv`: Contains additional data on oldest businesses in some countries to fill the gaps in the original dataset.
