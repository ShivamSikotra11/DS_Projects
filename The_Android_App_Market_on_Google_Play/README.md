# The Android App Market on Google Play

## Project Overview
> This project focuses on analyzing the Google Play Store app data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to app success. The goal is to explore the available data, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and then analyze the data to extract meaningful patterns and trends. By understanding the key factors that influence app performance and user ratings, developers and app publishers can make informed decisions to improve their app's visibility, popularity, and user satisfaction.

## Implementation
> The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` file. This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization for proper interpretaion of difference between apps in terms of various factors.This also includes the sentiment analysis of user on various types of apps.

## Data
> The dataset used for this project is the `user_review.csv` and `apps.csv`. Both data are avaliable in `datasets` folder.Data includes information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, such as app category, size, ratings, reviews, and price. The dataset is used to analyze the relationships between different features and app ratings/success.
